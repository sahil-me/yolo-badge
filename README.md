## 📌 What is the YOLO Badge?  
The **YOLO badge** is earned by merging a Pull Request without any review being requested or submitted.  

- It’s called “YOLO” because you’re saying *“You Only Live Once”* and merging without anyone checking the code 😅.  
- **Merging without reviews is not a recommended practice in real projects**. This guide is only for educational purposes to help you earn the "YOLO" badge.

## 🛠️ Step-by-Step Guide  

### 👉 Two Ways to Earn YOLO Badge

## 1️⃣ Solo Method (Owner merges own PR)

1️⃣ **Create a New Repository**  
   - Go to GitHub → click **+** (top-right) → **New repository**.  
   - Name it: `github-yolo-badge-guide`.  
   - (Optional) Add description: *Step-by-step guide to earn the GitHub YOLO badge*.  
   - Set Visibility → **Public** (recommended so others can find it).  
   - Check ✅ **Add a README file**.  
   - Click **Create repository**.  


2️⃣ **Create a Branch**  
   - On your repo page → click the **branch dropdown** (default: `main`).  
   - Type: `yolo-branch` → press **Enter**.  
   - You now have a new branch.  


3️⃣ **Edit the README on Your Branch**  
   - Open `README.md` (GitHub shows it on the repo homepage).  
   - Click the ✏️ **pencil icon** to edit.  
   - Add a harmless change, e.g.:  
   ```
   🚀 YOLO Badge Test – edited from yolo-branch
   ```  
   - Scroll down → commit message:  
   ```
   Add YOLO demo change
   ```  
   - Choose “Commit directly to the yolo-branch” → click **Commit changes**.  


4️⃣ **Open a Pull Request**  
   - GitHub shows a yellow box: **Compare & pull request** → click it.  
   - Confirm base = `main`, compare = `yolo-branch`.  
   - PR Title (suggested):  
   ```
   Demonstration: earn YOLO badge (merge without review)
   ```  
   - PR Description (suggested):  
   ```
   This PR demonstrates merging without a review to earn the YOLO badge.
   ```  
   - Click **Create pull request**.  


5️⃣ **YOLO Merge (no review)** 
   - Important: **Do not request a review** and ensure **no review is submitted**.  
   - Click **Merge pull request** → **Confirm merge**. 
   - Done! 🎉 You just merged your own PR without review.
   
> Tip: If the Merge button is disabled, check Branch protection rules in Settings. Temporarily remove any rule that requires reviews/approvals for the demo.

---

## 2️⃣ Collaborator Method (Recommended ✅)

1️⃣ **Add a collaborator**  
   - Go to **Repo → Settings → Collaborators → Add people**  
   - Enter their **GitHub username/email** → they accept the invite.  

2️⃣ **Collaborator creates a PR**  
   - Collaborator forks your repo and makes a small change.  
   - They open a Pull Request into your repo.  

3️⃣ **Merge without review**  
   - As repo owner, open the PR.  
   - Important: **Do not request a review** and ensure **no review is submitted**.  
   - Click **Merge pull request** → **Confirm merge**.

⚡ This method reliably triggers the YOLO badge.

- Badges usually appear on your GitHub **Profile → Achievements** tab within a few minutes.  
- Sometimes it takes up to 24 hours to sync.  
- If it doesn’t show, repeat the process in a new repo (just in case GitHub didn’t register the action).

## 📌 What is the YOLO Badge?  
The **YOLO badge** is awarded when you **merge a Pull Request you created, without requesting or receiving a review**.  

- It’s called “YOLO” because you’re saying *“You Only Live Once”* and merging without anyone checking your code 😅.  
- Don’t do this in real projects but it’s fun to earn the badge.
